group oracc needs to exist (manual on OS X)

_www/apache users need to be in group oracc

need to create $ORACC/tmp/rpc and permit the dir to rwxrwx--- with owner whatever:oracc

$ORACC_BUILDS needs to be group oracc with sgid

need to place session authentication info in the session dir to match against data coming from client during status requests

need to define/explain context: 

 - for client this is the parent of 00atf, etc.--could be an actual
   project or could just be a temp dir layout just to work with a few
   texts in an ad hoc way

 - for server this is probably $ORACC/tmp/rpc/SESSION
