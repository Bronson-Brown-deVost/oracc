group oracc needs to exist (manual on OS X); on mac os use

	dseditgroup -o create oracc

_www/apache users need to be in group oracc -- for mac os use 

	dseditgroup -o edit -a _www -t user oracc

need to create $ORACC/tmp/rpc and permit the dir to rwxrwx--- with owner whatever:oracc

$ORACC_BUILDS needs to be group oracc with sgid

$ORACC/bld $ORACC/tmp $ORACC/pub $ORACC/xml $ORACC/www all need to be permitted g+w

need to place session authentication info in the session dir to match against data coming from client during status requests

need to define/explain context: 

 - for client this is the parent of 00atf, etc.--could be an actual
   project or could just be a temp dir layout just to work with a few
   texts in an ad hoc way

 - for server this is probably $ORACC/tmp/rpc/SESSION


PERMS SUMMARY:

      $ORACC/{bld,pub,tmp,xml,www} stinney:oracc drwsrwsr-x or -rw-rw-r-- or -rwx-rwx-r-x


NEED dsa DATA FILE IN oracc/coredata
