need to create /var/tmp/varoracc and permit the dir to _www on mac or apache on Linux

need to place session authentication info in the session dir to match against data coming from client during status requests

need to define/explain context: 

 - for client this is the parent of 00atf, etc.--could be an actual
   project or could just be a temp dir layout just to work with a few
   texts in an ad hoc way

 - for server this is probably /var/tmp/varoracc/SESSION
