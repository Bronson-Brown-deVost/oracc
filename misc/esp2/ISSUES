ESP2 Issues List:
=================

* fix navigation menu on page (only needs CSS, a la P3)

* divide glossary into header and entries so bookmarks are static at top of 
  page while browsing (same CSS-div techniques as P3)

* images must be sized physically to desired X-Y; img height=/width= doesn't work with gridding

* images go in 00static

* imagemaps should be dropped

* imageinline means image-not-floating rather than 'inline' in the text processing sense

* ncr builds a portal and makes it live; for testing, use oracc esp then ncr to do the proper 
  full rebuild which also handles the full text indexing
