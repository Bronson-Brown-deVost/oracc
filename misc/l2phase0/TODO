ALL scripts: -base/-project/-lang args

induct: work with -proj and -lang to find a file to induct into raw:

	- warn and refuse if it is not public (but allow a -force)
	- warn and refuse if it has errors (but allow a -force)
	- warn and refuse if the 00src file is bad (no force for this)

	* if the 00raw exists, compare it with origin and warn if it is later
