<h1>Oracc Documentation</h1>
<p>Oracc recognizes several roles people can fulfill when interacting
with the system.  A single person may act in more than one role.
At the top level, the documentation is divided up according to
the roles to which it is principally relevant.</p>

<h2><a href="/doc/user/index.html">User</a></h2>

<p>User is short for end-user, someone who is working with Oracc
for study.</p>

<h2><a href="/doc/builder/index.html">Builder</a></h2>

<p>A builder is someone who is working on texts actually helping
to build Oraccâtyping up data or lemmatizing, for example.</p>

<h2><a href="/doc/manager/index.html">Manager</a></h2>

<p>A manager is someone who helps administer an Oracc project and who
therefore needs to understand aspects of the system that builders and
users don't need to care about.</p>

<h2><a href="/doc/developer/index.html">Developer</a></h2>

<p>A developer is someone who is able to program Oracc at some
levelâwriting XQueries for the database, or style files for
the OpenDocument support, for example.</p>

<p>Developers may also be interested in the the 
<a href="/ns/index.html">Schema documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Sysadmin</h2>

<p>Oracc typically has several system administratorsâpeople
who are able to create new projects, edit the documentation,
restart the various services.</p>

<p><strong>Sysadmin documentation is only accessible to sysadmins.</strong></p>

<h2>Steerer</h2>

<p>The Oracc Steering Committee consists of a core of senior
Oracc users who are responsible for oversight and direction
of Oracc.  Steerers are always sysadmins, but sysadmins do
not necessarily always need to be steerers.</p>

<p><strong>Steerer documentation is only accessible to steerers.</strong></p>
