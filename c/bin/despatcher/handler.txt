Oracc Resolver Handlers:
========================

Oracc URIs consist of a variable prefix followed by some combination
of static components.  Any variables that select from the URI
constructed so far are given in the query string, ensuring that the
URIs themselves are stable.

Variable Components:
********************

	PROJECT
	PQX
	LANG

Static Components:
******************

	SELECTION
	VIEW
	FORMAT

URI Templates:
==============

A handler is defined by its URI template.  The URI template replaces
the leading variable components with the tokens:

	PRJ/PQX/LNG

It then concatenates any combination of the known URI segments in
the order:

    SELECTION/VIEW/FORMAT


This produces URI templates of the form:

     PRJ/PQX/tlit/proofing/xml

or

     PRJ/PQX/word


URI Handler Registration:
=========================

Handlers are registered by their template.  The have_components frame
is turned into a template and the template handler table is searched
for a matching entry.

This is done with a gperf table of the form:

 TEMPLATE    HANDLER
