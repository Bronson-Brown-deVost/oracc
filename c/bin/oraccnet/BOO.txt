BOO
===

boo is the client program for interaction with build.oracc.org.

boo commands are two-tiered: the main method and an optional submethod.

Some submethods may take a value, given in the form SUBMETHOD=VALUE.

The default main method is build.

MAIN METHODS
============

build
check
deploy
lemmatize
manifest
resources
update

BUILD
=====

Rebuild the project or part thereof as specified in the submethod.

Submethods: all content portal

Default: all (i.e., 'boo' is equivalent to 'boo build all')

CHECK
=====

Check the project or aspects thereof as specified in the submethod.

Submethods: all atf esp glo links

Default: atf

The submethod atf may take a value giving ATF processor arguments, e.g., atf=-c. See
the documentation for the ATF processor options for more details.

The submethods atf and glo may take an additional argument giving a filename in the form:

 file=some.atf

or

 file=some.glo

No directory/folder information should be given in these cases.

The command 'boo check some.atf' is equivalent to 'boo check atf file=some.atf'.

DEPLOY
======

Package the project or parts thereof and place them in the public downloads whence they can be picked up by the servers for installation.  Note: resources are automatically updated when a 'portal' or 'all' deployment is carried out.

Submethods: all content portal

LEMMATIZE
=========

Lemmatize the file argument.

Submethod: file

MANIFEST
========

Retrieve a manifest of the project's files on boo.

Submethods: echo xml

echo: print the manifest on stdout after retrieval (default is to put it in '01tmp/manifest.txt').

xml: generate the manifest in XML format rather than tabbed.

RESOURCES
=========

Update the resources (the 00res folder) on boo.  This is a smart update, so no additional arguments are required: the client retrieves a manifest and compares the results to the current 00res folder, sending any updated files and requesting the deletion of any files that are no longer required on boo.

Two non-user-visible submethods are used to achieve this which are equivalent to:

    boo resources delete [FILENAME]
    boo resources update [FILENAME]

UPDATE
======

Update the configuration and lemmatization files on boo, but don't do any building or checking beyond what that requires.
