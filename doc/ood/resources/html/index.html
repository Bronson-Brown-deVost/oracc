</h2></div><h1><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h1><p>This document provides an informal introduction to
  major Oracc resources as the foundational constituents of Oracc Open
  Data access.</p>

<p>Oracc resources are the kinds of things that users and builders
interact with and create on Oracc every day: projects, texts,
glossaries and so on.  Resources are generally made up of collections
of resources and some resources have a natural hierarchy in which it
makes sense to regard the subcomponents as resources in their own
right--the words of a glossary or the records of a catalogue, for
example.</p>

<p>In almost all cases, these common terms mean particular things in
their Oracc implementation which in turn has implications for the ways
in which their formal identifiers and access methods are defined.  In
this document we therefore describe each of Oracc's major resources in
a narrative manner as a means of explaining what such a resource is on
Oracc and of contextualizing the formal definition of URNs and
URIs.</p>

<h1><a name="Projects">Projects</a></h1>

<p>The project serves as the basic organizational unit of Oracc and is
a workspace within which one or more cuneiform texts is usually
edited, annotated and presented--these texts are referred to as the
project's corpus.  Not all projects have a corpus--some have only a
catalogue, or consist of a collection of pages which we call a
portal.</p>

<p>A project is both a resource in its own right and a home for any
number of other resources.</p>

<h1><a name="Catalogues">Catalogues</a></h1>

<p>The meaning of catalogue on Oracc is specifically a catalogue of
texts.  Three of these are system catalogues which provide identifiers
for texts and are called Pcat, Qcat and Xcat.  All other
text-catalogues are local to individual projects.</p>

<p>Note: CDLI is currently also developing a catalogue of seals but
this is not yet integrated into Oracc.</p>

<h2><a name="Pcat">Pcat</a></h2>

<p>Oracc's Pcat is a wrapper around the CDLI main catalogue.  The CDLI
catalogue aims to provide a comprehensive registry of ancient objects
and assigns to these IDs which begin with 'P' and are followed by six
digits.  We call these IDs P-numbers.</p>

<p>Oracc never assigns P-numbers and for active CDLI P-numbers, the
Pcat P-number always refers to the same object as its corresponding
CDLI P-number.</p>

<p>Pcat does, however, preserve P-numbers which are deleted from the
CDLI catalogue.  These deleted P-numbers are categorized as inactive
or active.  Deleted-inactive P-numbers are those where the deletion is
clearly justified.  Deleted-active P-numbers are those for which a
project manager is in disagreement with the deletion, usually because
the CDLI deletion is based on the merging of fragments which do not
have a provable physical join between them.  The status which Pcat
assigns to deleted P-numbers may change--for example, an active status
could be changed to inactive if a join ends up being conclusively
demonstrated.</p>

<p>Deleted-active P-numbers are assigned permanent X-numbers, see
below.</p>

<h2><a name="Qcat">Qcat</a></h2>

<p>Qcat covers not ancient objects but compositions.  There may be a
one-to-one relationship between a composition and the object on which
it is inscribed.  Qcat assigns IDs beginning with Q and followed by
six digits.  We call these IDs Q-numbers.</p>

<h2><a name="Xcat">Xcat</a></h2>

<p>Xcat covers texts of both kinds, objects and compositions, and is
used for two purposes, the provision of temporary identifiers for
works-in-progress and the assignment of permanent identifiers for
deleted-active P-numbers.</p>

<p>Xcat IDs consist of an 'X' followed by six digits, and we call them
(you should be able to guess this by now) X-numbers.  X-numbers are
split into two ranges.  X-numbers from X000001 to X899999 inclusive
are permanent X-numbers and correspond to a deleted CDLI P-numbers.
Thus X123456 corresponds to the object formerly known as P123456.</p>

<p>X-numbers from X900000 to X999999 inclusive are temporary
X-numbers.</p>

<p>Permanent X-numbers are stable in exactly the same way as Pcat
P-numbers and Q-cat Q-numbers.  Although they are assigned only to
deleted-active P-numbers, they may also correspond to deleted-inactive
P-numbers because the status of a deleted P number is subject to
change.</p>

<p>Temporary X-numbers are unstable.  They are assigned to projects as
needed and withdrawn when the temporarily numbered texts are assigned
P- or Q-numbers.  They may be reused and thus change their meaning
over time, but at any given time they are uniquely assigned to a
single project.</p>

<h2><a name="Project_Catalogues">Project Catalogues</a></h2>

<p>Projects may have their own catalogues which either follow the
structure of the CDLI P-catalogue or define their own structures.
Regardless of their structure, project catalogues are required to
align with the system catalogues via P-, Q-, or X-numbers (or a
PQX-number for short).</p>

<h1><a name="Texts">Texts</a></h1>

<p>An Oracc text resource is identified by a PQX-number and composed
of several parts.  The metadata is a resource drawn from a catalogue
which gives information about the object or composition.  Images of
the object or of hand-copies may be available from CDLI and are
treated as external resources.</p>

<p>A text usually has a transliteration--a rendering into roman
characters done according to strict conventions--and may have one or
more translations in various languages.  Some composite texts (those
with Q-numbers) are also edited as "scores" or tabular representations
of the signs preserved or provided by each examplar of a
composition.</p>

<h1><a name="Glossaries">Glossaries</a></h1>

<p>Oracc glossaries are, broadly speaking, collections of information
about words.  These words fall into several categories: regular
lexical items; names of entities (otherwise known as proper nouns);
and named entities (i.e., the entities to which proper nouns refer).</p>

<p>Two glossary formats are used on Oracc. The Corpus-Based Dictionary
is used for regular lexical items and names of entities, and serves as
a framework for the aggregation of data on the instances of words in a
corpus.</p>

<p>By contrast, the ESP Glossary file provides a collection of short
narrative definitions of entities which occur in a corpus.</p>

<p>Although languages are not resources as such, glossaries are named
by the language of the words they define, in accordance with Oracc's
implementation of ISO 639-3 language codes.  For entity names the
special pseudo-language qpn is used; for entities, the special
pseudo-language qpe is used.  Language-tags may thus stand as
referents to language-glossaries which are in turn the definitional
resources for languages on Oracc.</p>

<p>The three types of entry in the different glossaries are also
resources:</p>

<h2><a name="Words">Words</a></h2>

<p>A word resource has a relatively complex structure most of whose
components are not yet exposed as independent resources.  Words are
uniquely identified in a glossary by a combination of three of these
fields, however: the Citation Form (CF; the head word in the
glossary); the Guide Word (GW; a reference meaning or label used to
disambiguate otherwise identical head words) and the Part of Speech
(POS).</p>

<p>By convention, these fields are concatenated with square brackets
to form a string with the pattern CF[GW]POS.  For example, the
Sumerian noun lugal has the guideword "king" and is referred to as
lugal[king]N.</p>

<h2><a name="Names">Names</a></h2>

<p>Names are simply words which are classed as proper nouns of some
kind.  All proper nouns in Oracc have a POS which is an uppercase
letter followed by uppercase 'N', e.g., DN for divine names.  Names
are referred to by the same syntax as regular words, but the Guide
Word is always considered to be '00' (zero-zero).</p>

<h2><a name="Entities">Entities</a></h2>

<p>Entities are names which are not indefinite but definite.  Thus,
where a name is a label which could potentially refer to any number of
entities, an entity is a word with a specific referent.  To
differentiate names from entities a distinct syntax is used: entities
have no square brackets but are instead disambiguated by subscript
numbers.  Further, no POS is given in an entity reference: subscripts
are assigned continously across parts of speech, and the POS
information is reserved to the qpe glossary.</p>

<p>Entities are always qualified by a subscript even where there is
only one entity so far known to which the name applies.  Thus, every
entity in principle ends in a subscript letter from the Unicode range
U+2080 .. U+2089.</p>

<p>In practice, unsubscripted entities are canonically equivalent to
the entity with subscript 1; thus <code>Nineveh</code> is by
definition identical to <code>Nineveh₁</code>.</p>

<h1><a name="Sign_Lists">Sign Lists</a></h1>

<p>A sign list is analagous to a glossary in that it contains entries
on each sign in a writing system together with data about its readings
and, Unicode numbers and instances.  The only sign list presently
implemented on Oracc is the Oracc Global Sign List, a sign list of
Sumero-Akkadian Cuneiform, whose ISO15XXX code is Xsux.</p>
