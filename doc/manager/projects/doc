This is 'cdlproject'--a project management tool for CDL projects.

cdlproject must always be run from within a project subdirectory.

cdlproject understands the following commands:

    catalog  :: updates catalogue installation.

    check    :: perform various checks; say 'cdlproject check help' for more
                information.

    clean    :: remove unneeded files; currently just */*~ (i.e., emacs
                backup files).

    harvest  :: collect new words from the corpus and place them in
                lib/<LANG>.new; the new material can be reviewed but
                corrections *MUST* be made in the corpus sources or
                in lib/<LANG>.glo (the main glossary file).

    merge    :: redo the harvest and then merge the lib/<LANG>.new
                files with the main glossary files.

    rebuild  :: rebuild the corpus, glossaries and website; this does
                not doing any harvesting or merging.

The recommended workflow for glossary building is:
    0) begin with text data which is ATF-clean.
    1) lemmatize the texts; ensure they are ATF-clean with lem-checking,
       then add them to the 'sources' directory.
    2) run 'cdlproject harvest'.
    3) review lib/*.new and fix sources/*.atf or lib/*.glo as required.
    4) run 'cdlproject merge' (this automatically redoes the harvest).
    5) run 'cdlproject rebuild' if all seems well.
    6) if something goes wrong, you can retrieve the previous *.glo
       file from the 'backups' directory--multiple 'cdlproject merge'
       commands on the same day overwrite the same file.
