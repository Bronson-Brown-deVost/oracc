OB Lem guidelines

Use CACF as CF

Use mimation consistently on @OB CF

Assume logograms are mimated

Normalize syllabic writings consistently with spelling, i.e., final -im 
normalized as -im.

Normalize morphology according to standard paradigms not spelling, i.e., 
orthographically non-geminated radicals are geminated in normalization.

Dates:
====

Month names are in Akkadian, with CACF as CDA but OB CF as OB. Normalize logograms in nominative.

Days are um-absolute followed by number; U4 and numbers are separate words.

Year names which look like Sumerian are tagged as Sumerian as a matter of corpus-building strategy/consistency.

     u3 is not enough to look like Akkadian (other cases?)

(check on CDLI OB year names for other confusing lexemes)

Add disclaimer to the effect that this does not necessarily mean the YNs were read in Sumerian?
