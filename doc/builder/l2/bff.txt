The @bff Tag
============

The @bff is intended to support word byforms of various kinds.  The
general mechanism allows the individual byforms to be treated under
their own entries within the glossary and during lemmatization, but
then be kept separate or grouped together when the glossaries are
rendered.

Syntax
-----

The @bff tag's syntax consists of two required and two optional
arguments.  The required arguments are:

 =CLASS

	A single token which indicates which class of byform this is;
	the names of the tokens are language-specific.

 =OWNER 

 	A glossary link which must resolve to an @entry in the
	glossary.  Note that the @bff linkage points only from the
	byforms to the mainform; it is an error for a word named as an
	OWNER in @bff tag to have its own @bff tags.  The link has the
	same form as other glossary entry links: <CF [GW] POS>.  So,
	to link to ki aŋ, love, the form would be: <ki aŋ [love] V/t>.


The optional arguments are:

 =LABEL

	A human-readable label which may be rendered in the glossary
	and is intended to convey information about the byform to
	readers.  This may contain spaces and must be given in double
	quotes.

 =CODE

	A machine-readable code which is stored in the XML version of
	the glossary and is intended for use in machine-processing;
	may not contain spaces.


The required order of arguments is:

 @bff CLASS CODE LABEL OWNER

Sumerian Classes
--------------

 = SUPP

	Suppletive byform: used for suppletive verbs

 = COMP

	Compound byform: used for collapsed compounds of the type
	mu-un-si-sa2 for si ... sa2.  With this schema, there is an
	entry @entry sisa [set straight] V/t, with @base si-sa₂ and
	@form mu-un-si-sa₂ /si-sa₂ #mu.n:~.  The entry has @bff COMP
	si sa [make straight] V/t

 = GRAM

	Grammatical byform: used primarily for frozen verbal forms
	which exhibit variation in morphological markers.

Sumerian Labels
-------------

Labels are not used for Sumerian; they are constructed from the CODE argument

Sumerian Codes
-------------

Sumerian codes are used only for suppletive verbs.  They are
constructed of quadruples giving the following information, in the
following sequence:

 = Aspect

	P (perfective) or I (imperfective)

 = Number

	Sg (singular) or Pl (plural)

 = Case

	S (subject) or O (object)

 = Animacy

	H (human) or N (nonhuman)

If the selection criterion is not relevant to the suppletion, an
asterisk (*) is used.  Thus, typical suppletion codes include:

   P-Sg-*-*

   I-Pl-O-*

   I-Pl-S-N
