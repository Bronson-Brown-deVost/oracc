* Installing Piwik for Oracc

  - download the Piwik distribution from http://www.piwik.org
  
  - unzip the distribution

  - copy the files to the server, e.g.:

    scp -r piwik oracc@oracc.museum.upenn.edu:www/piwik

  - visit the oracc/piwik page with your web browser:

    http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/piwik

* Enabling Piwik for Oracc Projects

  - create the root/admin account at install time

  - start the mysql server

    mysql -u root -p

  - create the osc database

    CREATE DATABASE 'osc';

  - create the oracc user

    CREATE USER 'oracc'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'oracc';

  - give 'oracc'@'localhost' the necessary access:

    GRANT ALL ON osc.* TO 'oracc'@'localhost';

  - Enter the following in the Piwik Screen:

    server: localhost
    login: oracc
    password: MU=ju10
    database: osc
    table prefix: (leave blank)

  - Create the Piwik Superuser:

    login: oracc
    password: old CDL DU-based password
    email: osc@oracc.org
  
* For Each Project:

  Name is project name, all lowercase, slashes between subprojects

  URL is http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/PROJECTNAMEWITHSLASHES

  Piwik gives you a Javascript tag.  Simply copy this and paste it
  into a file in the Oracc lib directory 'piwik'. The file name 
  is the project name, with slashes replaced by underscores and ends
  in '.tag':

     lib/piwik/cams.tag
     lib/piwik/cams_ludlul.tag

  For now, you must log in to the Oracc server and run the script:

      piwik.sh

  To set the proper permissions on the tag files in order for the tag
  to be used.

  The Oracc pager handles tag insertion automatically for you.

  The Steerer or Sysadmin who is enabling Piwik for the project should
  also create a user with the name of the project, replacing slashes
  with underscores, and give the user permission to monitor the stats
  on that site.  For subprojects, it may be easier for the parent 
  project to be the monitor for all subprojects--in that case, nothing
  should need to be done for subprojects because they already start
  with the URL of the parent project.

  An exception to the above might be subprojects whose corpora are
  related to a portal that needs independent reportage for granting
  purposes, such as the KNP subcorpus of SAAo.  Each SAAo volume probably
  does not need its own analytics.

Note that Piwik doesn't allow you to create different users with the
same email address, so if one person is managing more than one
project, just give them View permissions for all of them at piwik
Settings/Users .

* To Check Statistics

  Point your browser at:

     http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/piwik

  And login as superuser if you need to manage users and projects,
  or as a user if you want to view your stats.

  The Oracc home files and documentation are tagged as 'oracc' and
  can be viewed by the user 'osc' with password on the pattern of
  the new project default password.
