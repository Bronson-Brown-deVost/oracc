* Setting Up the Hyper-Estraier Search Engine for Oracc

This is not as smooth as it should be, but it's not too bad:

  - install Hyper-Estraier from http://hyperestraier.sourceforge.net/
    (this is also mentioned in oracc-install.txt)

  - now do the base installation; this creates the index and marshalls
    Hyper-Estraier configuration files

  - to complete the process, copy estraier.cgi from the Hyper-Estraier
    distribution to $ORACC/www/cgi-bin

The documentation index should now be functional.

The documentation index is updated automatically by 
src/doc/install.sh which calls src/doc/00tools/estindex.sh. See
that script for further details.
