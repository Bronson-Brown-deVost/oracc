* Bootstrapping an Oracc Installation

Bootstrapping requires installation of four projects that
are used as system data: cdli, qcat, ogsl, and epsd.

After installing these projects you should install Piwik
if you want web analytics.  See oracc-piwik.txt.

** CDLI Installation

At present there is only one way of accessing the CDLI data
itself programmatically, which is to download the nightly 
dumps.  However, existing Oracc sites make available for 
download a static version of the CDLI data which can be used
even if you don't want to track the CDLI data nightly.

*** Static Installation

To initialize this on a new Oracc installation on NEWHOST:

 - create the cdli project:

   su
   ${ORACC}/00/sys/newproj.sh cdli
   exit
   exit
   ssh -XYC cdli@NEWHOST
   oracc init CDLI 'The Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative'
 
 - download the CDLI seed files from an existing CDLI installation.
   E.g., to download from oracc.museum.upenn.edu:

   curl http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/cdli/downloads/cdli.tar.gz 00any

 - Install the seed files (while logged in as cdli):

   tar zxof 00any/cdli.tar.gz
   
 - fix the ownerships of the downloaded files:

   su
   chown -R cdli:cdli *
   exit

 - rebuild the project

   oracc rebuild

 - When you want to update the catalogue, run the script 

   00bin/cdli-nightly.sh

*** Nightly Updates Installation

To set up nightly updates you need permission from the CDLI project
to use password-less login on their server.  Contact them directly
to ask if they will allow this.

** Qcat Installation

 - create the qcat project

 - install the qcat files from an existing Oracc server

 - rebuild qcat

** Ogsl Installation

 - create the ogsl project

 - install the ogsl files from an existing Oracc server

 - rebuild ogsl

** Epsd Installation

 - create the epsd project

 - install the epsd files from an existing Oracc server

 - rebuild epsd
