Install eXist in /usr/local/oracc/lib/java/eXist

copy ~/src/misc/system/eXist/conf.xml to lib/java/eXist

as oracc user run start-eXist.sh and stop-eXist.sh to
start and stop DB

Before a new project works in the db, a sysadmin must:

 run eXist-client.sh and log in as admin (pass=S...1)

 - use Tools/Edit Users
 - add the user with the project base name (e.g., cams,
   not cams/gkab) as user, give password (usually the
   standard default password) and assign 'project'
   as the group
 - quit

 create a file in the project home directory named `.exist':

 - log in as root or as project
 - cat >.exist
 - type password, with no newline at the end and then
   Control-D to end the cat >.exist
 - set the owner if you were logged in as root:

    chown PROJ:PROJ .exist 
 
 - set the perms to read-nobody except the owner

    chown go-r .exist

 load the project data into eXist:

 - log in as project
 - oracc eXist
