Installing XeTeX:
=================

RHEL often provides out-of-date TeX.  Here is how to fix
that as of 2012:

# get rid of RH version
yum erase texlive*
curl -O http://jnovy.fedorapeople.org/texlive/texlive-release-2011.el6.noarch.rpm
rpm -Uvh texlive-release-2011.el6.noarch.rpm

# Now that gives you an /etc/yum.repo.d/texlive repo.  We'll install
# xetex from that by disabling the RH repos, but first we need to 
# install t1lib because that dependency doesn't get resolved by Yum:
yum install t1lib
yum --disablerepo r* texlive-2011-xetex-bin-x86_64

# Now we are close.  One more dep to install which gets missed
# by yum:
yum --disablerepo r* texlive-xetex-def

# Now log in as oracc and rebuild the format:
mk-oracctex.sh

That should be it ...
