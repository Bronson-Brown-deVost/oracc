* Sysadmin Documentation

** Sysadmin programs

Executable versions of all sysadmin programs are kept in 00/sys, which
is only readable by the oracc user.  When a program is named in this
documentation, the full path to the program is the path of the oracc
installation followed by 00/sys followed by the program name.  For a
typical installation, then, the full path to the program newproj.sh
is /usr/local/oracc/00/sys/newproj.sh.

Some of these scripts can only run as root; they will complain when
run as a regular user.


** Environment Variables

Several environment variables are used by Oracc; they must be set
either in a system-wide login script (e.g., bash's /etc/profile) or
in the user login scripts, including those for the oracc user and
the root user when root is performing Oracc sysadmin tasks.

++ ORACC

   This is the path to the Oracc installation, by default /usr/local/oracc.


++ ORACC_VAR

   This is the path to the Oracc variable data tree, by default /var/local/oracc.

++ ORACC_HOME

   This is the path to the Oracc project directories, by default /home.

** ORACC_HOST

   This is the host name to use for Oracc web services; it may be the
   host on which the system is installed, or it may be a different
   host.  It is therefore not a requirement for a local installation
   to run the webservices.

To set the variables from the command line, use the oracc admin script
${ORACC}/bin/oraccenv.sh.

To call oraccenv.sh you may be able simply to copy or link it to 
/etc/profile.d .   If your bash's /etc/profile doesn't automatically
load the files in that directory, you can add to /etc/profile the
line:

	. /usr/local/oracc/bin/oraccenv.sh

Where the first token is a single period, followed by a space, and the path
/usr/local/oracc must be replaced by the path to Oracc's bin directory
on the installation in question.

Instructions for other shells and non-Unix systems will vary.

** Oracc permissions scheme

*** Oracc installation

*** Oracc projects

Oracc projects have several groups of directories which are described
in the Manager documentation.  Directories with a 00 prefix are u+rwx
project, g+r-x and o+---.

Directories with a 01 or 02 prefix have the same permissions as 00
directories for user and group, but are also o+r-x.

*** Groups

On project creation, projects are added to the oracc group, and the
oracc user is added to the project group.

** Project tasks

To create or delete a project, first login as oracc and issue the
'su' command to become superuser.  At this point extreme care is 
necessary because the superuser ("root") has no restrictions on
what can be done on the machine.

*** Creating a new project

New user-projects are created with the script newproj.sh, which takes
a single argument, the name of the new project.  This must be all
lowercase.  It must start with a letter from a to z, but may include
digits after that.

So, to create a new project 'amarna' on a standard installation, the 
full command would be (executed as root):

  /usr/local/oracc/00/sys/newproj.sh amarna

New sub-projects (those which belong to a user-project) can be created
by users themselves, and must be created while logged in as the user.
More information is given in the Manager documentation.

*** Completing Project Creation

To complete the process of project creation, logout as root and login
as the user.  Run `oracc init' with the project's standard abbreviation
and long name as arguments.  The standard abbreviation must be the same
as the created project name, but it may use uppercase characters.  So,
for a top-level project whose userid is 'epsd', the init command would
be:

 oracc init ePSD 'The electronic Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary'

Note the quotes around the long name to preserve the spaces.

*** Deleting a project

User-projects can be deleted with the script delproj.sh, which takes a
single argument, the name of the project to be deleted.  A complete
copy of the project is archived in /deleted_home before the user is
deleted, and may be removed when no further use for it is likely.

So, to delete a project 'amarna' on a standard installation, the full
command would be (executed as root):

  /usr/local/oracc/00/sys/delproj.sh amarna

Sub-project deletion is described in the Manager documentation.

** Service tasks

Oracc runs several services: the webserver, the eXist database, the
Tomcat servlet container.  Each service has a script to start and to
stop it (or will: they aren't written yet).


** Maintenance tasks

Oracc uses a number of temporary files which can be cleaned up by the
maintenance scripts.

** Scheduled tasks

Oracc makes use of crontab to schedule certain tasks.
