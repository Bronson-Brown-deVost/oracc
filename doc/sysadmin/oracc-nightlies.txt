*Oracc Server Nightlies

This page describes the configuration of tasks run nightly on the
server. On a Unix machine these are managed using the program `cron'
and its configuration file, `crontab'. To edit a crontab, log in as
the user and type:

 EDITOR=emacs crontab -e

To set up crontab for user cdli:

 su
 crontab -u cdli $ORACC/src/doc/sysadmin/crontab.cdli

** Nightlies for user oracc

The oracc user changes the featured project hourly:

1,15,30,45 * * * * /usr/local/oracc/src/doc/wwwhome/projlist/mk-featured.sh

** Nightlies for user cdli

The user cdli runs a nightly grab of the CDLI catalogue and installs
it.

The cdli crontab looks like this:

PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/home/cdl/bin:/usr/local/oracc/bin
#
# update CDLI catalog installation
#
0 5 * * * /usr/local/oracc/cdli/00bin/cdli-nightly.plx 2>$HOME/00any/nightly.log

The first non-zero number is the time to run the job; the second is
the day of the month.

** Nightlies for user root

The superuser backs up all the projects every night.

The root crontab looks like this:

PATH=/bin:/usr/bin/
bin=/usr/local/oracc/bin

#
# Back up the Oracc src; full backup on first of month,
# incremental all other nights
#
## 0 2 1 * * $cdladmin/full-backup.sh 2>$HOME/fullback.log
## 0 2 2-31 * * $cdladmin/incr-backup.sh 2>$HOME/incrback.log

#
# Back up all the projects; full backup on first of month,
# incremental all other nights
#
bin=/usr/local/oracc/bin
0 3 1 * * $bin/projsave-all.sh full 2>$HOME/projsave-full.log
0 3 2-31 * * $bin/projsave-all.sh incr 2>$HOME/projsave-incr.log
