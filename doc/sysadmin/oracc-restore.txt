Before restoring, back up all the home directories and
create a new Oracc restoreset with

 00/sys/mk-restore-set.sh

Reinstall the OS and follow the instructions in
oracc-preparation.txt to create the oracc user
and install the oracc restore set from wherever you
unpacked it (probably in the home directory of the
initial user):

 (cd / ; tar zxf /home/user/restoreset/tar/oracc.tar.gz)

Uncompress all the home directories into /home.

Migrate the users and reboot

Reset all the links with 00sys/mk-varoracc-links.sh
