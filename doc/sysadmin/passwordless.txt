Password-less sign-on to CDLI server (dsa):
===========================================

Login to cdli account on oracc.

If you don't already have a id_dsa.pub key in your users .ssh
directory you would need to issue the following command to create one:

   ssh-keygen -t dsa -C "cdli@servername" 

The -C is just a comment for the public/private key pair.

Once the id_dsa.pub key is located in .ssh you need to "append" it to
the authorized_keys file in the CDLI users directory with the
following command:

 cat .ssh/id_dsa.pub | ssh cdli@128.97.154.151 'cat - >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

**Make sure you have >> and not just a single > because that will
overwrite the authorized_keys file.**

You will be prompted for the cdli password.

To test that this is working, you can try to ssh to the cdli server
with the cdli user and you shouldn't be prompted for a password.
