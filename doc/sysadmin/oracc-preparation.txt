* Preparing a new Oracc installation

For a new Oracc installation, follow these steps:

 - create the directory where the Oracc installation will live;
   until path handling is abstracted out into a library routine
   the only paths that will work in practice are:

   @@ORACC@@
   @@ORACC@@

 - create a user 'oracc' with home set to @@ORACC@@:

   /usr/sbin/useradd -d @@ORACC@@ oracc

 - set a password:

   /sbin/passwd oracc

 - create a group 'oracc' if necessary:

   /usr/sbin/groupadd oracc

 - change ownership of /{usr,var}/local/oracc to oracc:

   chown oracc:oracc /{usr,var}/local/oracc

 - set @@ORACC@@ to be non-world-readable:

   chmod o-r @@ORACC@@

 - log in as root

 - create necessary directories:

   /deleted_home /oraccbak

 - log in as oracc

 - create necessary directories:

   mkdir -p 00/sys src
   mkdir -p /var/tmp/oracc/{atfserver,pager}
   chmod o+w /var/tmp/oracc/*

 - put the current Oracc distribution in 00, and unpack it
   in src (let's say you've downloaded it to /tmp):

   cp /tmp/oracc-2010-06-23.tar.gz 00
   cd src ; tar zxf ~/00/oracc-2010-06-23.tar.gz

 - edit src/misc/admin/oraccenv.sh appropriately for your
   environment.  If you are not going to host the webservices
   yourself you can set ORACC_HOST to oracc.museum.upenn.edu.

 - edit src/sys/skel/.bash_profile if necessary; depending on 
   the system, it may be necessary to copy the system skel
   files (e.g., from /etc/skel) and add the following line to
   the end:

   . @@ORACC@@/bin/oraccenv.sh

   The path should be the the same as ORACC in oraccenv.sh

 - copy the skeleton files to the oracc user home:
   
   cp src/sys/skel/.* ~

 - source the environment so the build will work:

   . src/misc/admin/oraccenv.sh

   Note that if you log in and log out before the installation
   has at least reached the point of copying the misc/admin
   files, you will need to source this file manually each
   time.

 - now follow the instructions in oracc-install.txt and

   ***
   continue with the next step in this file when you
   are done
   ***

 - now that Oracc is installed, you need to finish up the
   installation of the root-only tools:

   cd ${ORACC}src/sys
   ./install.sh
   cd ${ORACC}/00
   su
   chown root:oracc sys
   chmod go-rx sys

 - finally, edit the root-only script newproj.sh to set
   a default password for new project accounts.  Change
   the line:

   ## echo -n ******** /usr/bin/passwd --stdin $project

   To uncomment it, and replace ******** with the
   default password.  The root ownership and restrictive
   permissions will ensure that no one is able to see
   this.

   After saving the file and exiting your text editor,
   use `exit' to logout of being root.

 - Now you are ready to start adding data to Oracc, 
   starting with the catalogues.  This is described in
   oracc-bootstrap.txt.
