<h1 class="title">Project Web Management</h1><h2 class="author">Steve Tinney<br/>Version of 2010-04-04
</h2><h1><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h1><p>This document gives an account of Oracc project web
  management facilities, principally the various CSS style files and
  Javascript source files that are included in HTML pages.</p>

<h1><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h1>

<p>The styling and javascript are controlled at several levels.  There
is the system styling in files with a <code>cdl</code> prefix; the
pager styling in files with a <code>pager</code> prefix; and the
project styling in files with a <code>project</code> prefix.</p>

<p>System styling cannot be modified by projects, but it is loaded
first and so can be overridden.</p>

<p>Pager styling can be modified by projects via the configuration
file <code>lib/config.xml</code>.  The intention is that for most
projects this will be adequate and so project owners can at least
modify the colour schemes without knowing any CSS.</p>

<p>Project styling consists of files manually created by the project
owners.  It requires knowledge of CSS and/or Javascript as well as the
internals of which <code>class</code> attributes are used by the
Oracc processing programs. These internals are not documented, but
someone familiar with basic web tricks and tools should be able to
look at the HTML sources to determine how to adjust CSS styling.</p>

<p>Although we only discuss CSS below, the same principles apply to
Javascript source files with the exception that only absolute file
names are recognized.</p>

<h1><a name="Media">Media</a></h1>

<p>Open-ended multiple media support is built in to the file syntax
in the Oracc web management configuration. All filenames can be either
an absolute or a pair, with the parts separated by a hyphen.  For
pairs, the first component is the configuration level, the second the
intended media:</p>

<pre class="example">
cdl.css           # absolute file name, used for all media
cdl-screen.css    # media-specific file for screen
</pre>

<p>The following CSS2 media types are understood:</p>

<pre class="example">
braille embossed handheld print projection screen speech tty tv</pre>

<p>Media queries are not yet supported.</p>

<h1><a name="Processing">Processing</a></h1>

<p>The pager CSS may be given in the <code>websources/</code>
directory or the colours may be given according to the configuration
options in <code>lib/config.xml</code>.  The latter approach is
<strong>strongly</strong> recommended as it ensures that the proper
CSS will be generated for the pager's needs.</p>

<p>Project CSS must be stored in <code>websources/</code>.</p>

<p>When a project is rebuilt, the contents of <code>websources/</code>
are copied to <code>web/</code> as usual.  The project configuration,
<code>lib/config.xml</code> is then processed to create the pager CSS
files in <code>web/</code> unless the relevant files already exist in
<code>web/</code>.</p>

<p>Now, the project manager reviews all the CSS and JS files in
<code>web/</code> and creates a text file containing the HTML
<code>link</code> and <code>script</code> commands necessary to
utilize all of the CSS/JS in the proper order.  The generated
fragment, <code>css-js.xml</code>, is well-formed XML so that it can
be referenced via XML tools.  However, it cannot be included as-is in
the <code>head</code> of an HTML document because of its document
root.  Given the project name (stored in a variable
<code>$project</code>), say, the fragment can be processed using the
following XSLT code assuming that the calling XSLT script lives in the
standard <code>cdl/lib/scripts</code> (the actual call could be given
without the variable, which is used here for clarity):</p>

<pre>
&lt;xsl:variable name="css-js" 
              select="concat('../../projects/',$project,'/web/css-js.xml')"/&gt;
&lt;xsl:copy-of select="document($css-js, / )/*)"/&gt;
</pre>

<h1><a name="Pager_CSS">Pager CSS</a></h1>

<p>The various class attributes used by the pager for its
colour-skinning need to be documented.  But first they need some
rationalization, so this is likely to be a while coming.</p>
