<h3>
<span class="slidenum"><small>WNM</small>.1.i  </span>Note on Revised Version</h3>
<div class="slidebody"><p>This document was originally written in April 2002 in order to establish the general principles for dealing with numbers and number systems for CDLI.  As of June 2004, the infrastructure described below has largely been implemented in the <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/doc/ATF/">ATF to XTF processor's</a> number parsing routines.  The body of this document has not yet been revised as the XML data formats have not yet been finalized; the major change in the text below is the elimination of the 'minimalist' notation.  For further information on number notations see the <a href="/doc/ATF/numbers.html">Numbers and Metrology Basics document</a>.
</p></div>
<h3>
<span class="slidenum"><small>WNM</small>.1.ii  </span>Disclaimer</h3>
<div class="slidebody"><p>The development of a set of precise notations for cuneiform numeric and metrological data poses a substantial challenge; this document aims to work from the known to the unknown, in the explicit expectation that it will be revised repeatedly, perhaps interminably. It is also expected that any revisions will be backward-compatible with previous versions of this document.
</p></div>
<h3>
<span class="slidenum"><small>WNM</small>.1.iii  </span>Use-cases</h3>
<div class="slidebody">
<p>We require a notation and implementation which:</p>
<ul>
<li>is easy for data enterers to input</li>
<li>is easy for data collators to correct</li>
<li>permits unambiguous representation of numeric graphemes</li>
<li>permits representation on the level of raw formal graphemes (3(u))</li>
<li>permits representation on the level of interpreted graphemes (3(bur3))</li>
<li>facilitates reliable machine-interpretation</li>
<li>supports an override mechanism to force specific machine-interpretation</li>
<li>converts without loss of information from ASCII format to XML format and back again</li>
<li>is expandable</li>
<li>allows conversion to ancient base values (for mathematical operations)</li>
<li>allows conversion to modern base values (for visualizing quantities)</li>
<li>? is portable (i.e., can be used with DTD's and Schemas other than the CDLI one) ?</li>
</ul>

<span class="slidenum"><small>WNM</small>.2  </span>Definitions</h1>
<div class="slidebody"><p>It is necessary to define specific terms for each of the aspects of number-production in cuneiform writing.
</p></div>
<h3>
<span class="slidenum"><small>WNM</small>.2.i  </span>Formal Constituents</h3>
<div class="slidebody"><dl>
<dt>Unit</dt>
<dd>an element of measure, e.g., sila3, gur, etc.</dd>
<dt>Count</dt>
<dd>a means of expressing 1 or more of a Unit.</dd>
<dt>Value</dt>
<dd>a single combination of COUNT and UNIT.</dd>
<dt>Ancient Equivalency Value (AEV)</dt>
<dd>an ancient equivalency VALUE, e.g., 5000 sila3; a property of either UNIT, VALUE or AMOUNT.</dd>
<dt>Modern Equivalency Value (MEV)</dt>
<dd>a modern equivalency VALUE, e.g., 1 liter; a property of either UNIT, VALUE or AMOUNT.</dd>
<dt>System</dt>
<dd>a definitional collection of UNITs, COUNTs, VALUEs, AEVs and MEVs which may optionally be localized in time and/or place and/or by keyword.</dd>
<dt>Quantity</dt>
<dd>a complete sequence of VALUEs expressed in a given SYSTEM.</dd>
<dt>Commodity</dt>
<dd>the counted referent of an AMOUNT.</dd>
</dl></div>
<h3>
<span class="slidenum"><small>WNM</small>.2.ii  </span>Written Instantiation</h3>
<div class="slidebody"><dl>
<dt>Count-grapheme</dt>
<dd>a grapheme which represents a simple numeric value such as 1(disz); Count-graphemes are ambiguous with respect to unit in context-free situations.</dd>
<dt>Unit-grapheme</dt>
<dd>a grapheme which establishes the unit of the preceding count-grapheme.</dd>
<dt>Integral-value-grapheme</dt>
<dd>a grapheme which represents a VALUE in a SYSTEM by virtue of its integral constitution, e.g.,  BANMIN, i.e., "PA" in the sense of 2-BAN.  Integral-value-graphemes are unambiguous with respect to unit in context-free situations.</dd>
<dt>Repeater-value-grapheme</dt>
<dd>a grapheme which represents a VALUE in a SYSTEM by virtue of being repeated to express multiples of itself, e.g., esze2. Repeater-value-graphemes  are unambiguous with repect to unit in context-free situations.</dd>
<dt>System-grapheme</dt>
<dd>a grapheme which serves to specify the SYSTEM of an AMOUNT.</dd>
<dt>System Diagnostic Significance (SDS)</dt>
<dd>a property of graphemes or grapheme combinations which serves to identify diagnostically the SYSTEM of a given AMOUNT.  
<strong>ISSUE: HOW TO SPECIFY THIS FORMALLY?</strong>

<span class="slidenum"><small>WNM</small>.3  </span>Implementation</h1>
<div class="slidebody"><p>'Implementing numbers' for CDLI requires definition of several formats and the creation of software to bridge the formats:
</p></div>
<h3>
<span class="slidenum"><small>WNM</small>.3.i  </span>ATF Notations</h3>
<div class="slidebody">
<p>The fully-qualified notation explicitly notates every grapheme which makes up an AMOUNT, and qualifies the grapheme in terms of count and unit.
</p>
<p>In fully-qualified notation, the graphemes are disambiguated according to their form and unit-reference.  E.g., <code>1(disz)</code>,
<code>3(sila3)</code>.
</p>
<p>Additionally, the fully-qualified version will explicitly give the system at the start of the AMOUNT.  The notation used for languages, i.e., <code>%s</code>(=sumerian) and so on can be extended for use with SYSTEMS to avoid having too many escape characters.  Thus, the fully-qualified version will express a sexagesimal number as, e.g.,
<code>%sx 1(disz)</code>.  
</p>
<p>Given that reducing all localized systems to a brief short-hand will be difficult, we should anticipate that less commonly used systems will be named with a notation such as
<code>%sys=&lt;system-name&gt;</code>, e.g.,
<code>%sys=sexagesimal</code>.
</p>
</div>
<h3>
<span class="slidenum"><small>WNM</small>.3.ii  </span>XML Notations</h3>
<div class="slidebody">
<p>In the present implementation of cdli-text.dtd a generic tag
<code>&lt;n&gt;</code> is used to identify numbers.  This tag will remain as a non-system-specific way of marking a sequence of graphemes known to represent a number.  In the normal case, however, the N tag will be superseded by a Q tag indicating a QUANTITY.  This step will normally be made programmatically, and the extant N will remain embedded in the Q for ease of auditing.
</p>
<p>The new Q tag is defined by the following DTD fragment which is simplified to the extent that it is not namespaced.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;!-- 
 The Q element contains a QUANTITY consisting of an optional N (which
 is the original grapheme sequence classified as N in initial
 conversion process) followed by a sequence of COUNT-UNIT pairs, an
 optional system-classifier (SYS-CLASS).
<br>
 The @SYSTEM attribute on Q defines the SYSTEM and is an IDREF which
 should refer to the XML database of systems.
<br>
 The @MEV attribute enables caching of modern-equivalency-values.
<br>
 The @AEV attribute enables caching of ancient-equivalency-values.
<br>
 This means that display of texts can toggle between displaying the
 original 'N', the digested sequence of count-unit pairs, the modern 
 equivalent or the ancient equivalent (expressed in the base unit of
 the respective system).
 --&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT q  (n? , cu+ , sys-class?)&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST q
	system IDREF #REQUIRED
	mev    CDATA #IMPLIED
	aev    CDATA #IMPLIED &gt;
&lt;!--
 The CU element encodes a count-unit pair as an abstraction derived
 from the written form. The information is encoded as a pair of
 attributes giving the count (@C) and unit (@U).
 --&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT cu EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST cu
	c CDATA #REQUIRED
	u CDATA #REQUIRED &gt;
</pre>
<p>We assume that N contains graphemic data as defined in cdli-text.dtd, and that this data represents the actual grapheme sequence rather than interpreted values (i.e., numbers like 263 are deconstructed into their constituent elements).
</p>
<p>Note that with this design we do not link directly from count-unit pair to written instantiation; should we?  Also, we do not cache equivalency values for individual count-unit pairs; should we?
</p>
</div>
<h3>
<span class="slidenum"><small>WNM</small>.3.iii  </span>SYSTEM</h3>
<div class="slidebody">
<p>Every QUANTITY given in an actual text must have a specified SYSTEM (even if that SYSTEM is the special value 'unknown').  This allows software to perform more advanced validity-checking as well as equivalency calculation.  It also opens up the potential for corpus-queries such as 'show me all uses of system x where it is measuring y'.
</p>
<p>Systems are defined in a separate XML document, and identified by identifiers which consist of a base system (sexagesimal, weight, capacity, etc.) followed by optional qualifiers in the sequence:
<code>BASE-DATE-PLACE-KEY</code>.
</p>
<p>This permits such identifiers as <code>weight-ur3-ur-royal</code>.</p>
<p>TODO: define the XML format of a system.</p>
