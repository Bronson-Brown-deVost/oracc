* Install Xcode if necessary

* Check basic tools are up to date (in this order):
  m4
  autoconf
  automake
  libtool

* Install required libraries
  
  ** should provide colorer and correct HRD
  ** delete ref to libstemmer as it's included in oracc

 Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.8, 2010-05-17

   . in all cases, configure with:

     ./configure --prefix=/usr

   . ****don't upgrade libtool****; non-Apple version doesn't
     grok `ranlib -q', which breaks gmp build

   . gmp-5.0.1 (and gmp-4.x.x, don't bother trying) fail
     to build with duplicate symbol errors owing to a problem
     with extern inline.  Edit gmp-h.in to 

     	  #undef __GMP_EXTERN_INLINE 
     
     around line 1680

     Build with CFLAGS='-O2 -m64'

  . utf8proc fails to build because it wants _main for the .so lib.
    Edit Makefile to comment out the .so target in c-library.

  . tre config needs 

    CFLAGS=-m64 ./configure --prefix=/usr

  . libuninum fails to find gmp; make configure use -m64:

    CFLAGS=-m64 ./configure --prefix=/usr

  . msort needs:

    LDFLAGS=-m64 ./configure --prefix=/usr

    then:

    make CFLAGS='-O2 -m64'
    make install

   . Leopard (X generally) comes without XML::LibXSLT; the shipped
     versions of libxml and friends won't work with the latest 
     XML::LibXSLT, so the easiest thing is to download 1.60 from
     oracc/downloads and use that.

   . download and install colorer from oracc/downloads; edit out
     shared library build from Makefile.in, make, then:

     mkdir -p /usr/local/share/colorer
     cp -pR bin/colorer /usr/local/bin
     cp -pR bin hrc hrd /usr/local/share/colorer
     
     (I didn't use the makefile.macos)

   . PCRE

   configure as:

     CFLAGS=-m64 LDFLAGS=-m64 ./configure --prefix=/usr \
          --enable-shared=no --disable-cpp

     make CFLAGS='-O2 -m64' LDFLAGS=-m64

   . Oracc src

   CFLAGS=-m64 LDFLAGS=-m64 ./configure
