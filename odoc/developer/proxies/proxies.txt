Proxies
=======

*) Proxies are implemented by giving a list of P-numbers in lib/proxies.lst.

   ISSUE: syntax needs to be extended to allow prefixing P-numbers with a project

*) Proxies are borrowed from other projects at the ATF level; this ensures 
   single-sourcing but otherwise keeps the upstream processing simple because all
   of the proxied texts subsequently appear like any other text in the project's
   texts tree.

*) Before any other processing, the proxy manager harvests the necessary ATFs based
   on lib/proxies.lst and places them in results/proxies.atf.

*) Proxies are then included in glossaries by being processed along
   with the rest of the project ATFs.
