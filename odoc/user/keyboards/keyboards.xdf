  <dc:description>This page presents a collection of keyboards supporting Unicode transliterations,
implementing a consistent set of input conventions across operating
systems.</dc:description>
</d:meta>

<p>Custom keyboard layouts are not hard to create or install on
Windows, Mac OS X or Unix's X11.  However, there are some technical
issues which make it impossible to create a single keyboard layout
which works the same across all systems.</p>
<p>The design strategy adopted here makes commonly used characters
easily accessible in keyboards which are adapted from the standard
national keyboards.  This means that for much work it will be
comfortable to use the transliteration keyboard, and users can easily
switch to the standard national keyboard when necessary.</p>
<h1>Core Characters</h1>
<p>On Windows and Mac OS X, the core characters are all reached using
the comma as a prefix key (dead key); for a list, see <a
href="/doc/user/unicode/">the Unicode page</a>.</p>
<h1>Accented Vowels</h1>
<p>These are usually available in various ways from the national
keyboards.  In addition, we define a set of fallback keyboard
combinations to provide access to the accented vowels as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>,-vowel = vowel + macron</li>
<li>ctrl+,-vowel = vowel + circumflex</li>
<!-- <li>shift+,-vowel = vowel + acute</li>
<li>shift+control+,-vowel = vowel + grave</li> -->
</ul>

<h1>Determinatives</h1>


<p>In ATF, the correct markup for determinatives is to enclose them in
curly brackets.  In word-processing contexts the superscript style
should be used.</p>

<p>The commonest ATF determinatives can be written with the following keyboard combinations:</p>

<ul>
<li>,-d = {d}</li>
<li>,-f = {f}</li>
<li>,-k = {ki}</li>
<li>,-l = {luâ‚‚}</li>
<li>,-m = {m}</li>
</ul>

<p>Limited support for superscript determinatives is included in the
Oracc fonts (this currently only applies to Desconsolata).  This support
is not intended for general purpose applications, but is provided for
the creation of manuscript matrices where alignment is important and
the use of a tabular layout is not an option for plain text files.
These superscript characters are mostly available from the semi-colon
deadkey, with a few reached from the colon deadkey.</p>

<h1>Mac OS X Keyboards</h1>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Download and unzip the keyboard(s) you wish to use and copy them to
the <code>Library/Keyboard Layouts</code> folder in your home
directory/folder.</li>
<li>Log out and log in again.</li>
<li>Open the 'International' item under 'System
Preferences' (or from the flag in your menu bar if you have one) and
look for the relevant name(s) in the list--click on the checkbox to
include the new keyboard(s) in your list of available keyboards.</li>
<li>Ensure that 'Show input menu on menubar is checked.</li>
<li>You should now be able to switch keyboards via the icon in the
menubar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that Mac OS X will sometimes 'helpfully' switch keyboards when you
switch applications or even windows, so you may want to define a
keyboard shortcut to select your favourite transliteration keyboard.
Alternatively, if you find that you can work comfortably with the
transliteration keyboard all the time, you can remove all other
keyboards from your list in the 'International' settings.</p>

<h1>Windows Keyboards</h1>

<h2>Installation </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Download and unzip the keyboard(s) you wish to use and
  double-click on the installer appropriate for your computer (for
  most people this will be the i386 installer.</li>
  <li>Use the Keyboards item in the Control Panel to add the keyboard
  to the ones you use and optionally set up a keystroke combination to
  switch between keyboards.</li>
</ul>
