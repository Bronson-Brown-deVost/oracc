Install:
========

* install xsltforms runtime

* add argument handling to p3-html-wrapper.xsl

* need a diagnostic when @note in trans is not followed by blank line

-* Check things that may have broken now that all p2 css/js has been removed

P3:
===

* images in the esp pages do not come out (by design?)

* very brief test of advanced search seemed to be fine (combining
transliteration with transliteration and transliteration with
catalog). Combination of searching for transliteration gu-za with
translation chair does not yield results.

* Check things that may have broken now that all p2 css/js has been removed

* oversize heading in cbd sig popup

* what are all the (-1x) items in gkab glos?

-* in the glossaries, when I click on a letter in the left pane, the
search box needs to be empty or else nothing happens.

-* in the pager, going from an edition to a glossary item works
    fine. Then from the glossary item to a list of attestations does
    not work.  example: Q000035 line 21 links to entry ub[corner](N)
    which has 11 attestations. Clicking on anything there opens an
    empty window with the alphabet in the left pane (same thing
    happens when starting from a P) 

-* when opening the Sumerian glossary I get a summary list of A
    words. If I click on any of those words I get an empty page. When
    I click on A (in left pane) I get the full A word entries and when
    clicking on those words a glossary page opens (correctly). In
    those glossary pages the links work (opening a list of
    attestations), but the links to those attestations open an empty
    page.

-* in the pager searching for dug3 I get 269 items in 11 pages. For
   some reason page 4 is empty (haven't found any rhyme or reason
   there). Something similar happens when searching for lemmatization
   aszte

- * when I search in the glossaries for anything it downloads a file
called "pager"

-* esp2 not installed by ncr

-* note numbers need to be ignored--can use ^^ or ^1^ etc. just to make it 
  easier to know which notemark correlates with which note; need to number
  sequentially across text

-* Niek's !txt lugal !cat nippur in AS

-* scribesscholarsancestors: sort sequence bad for letters only; entries sort OK

-* http://oracc/cams/gkab/literacies/index.html image link is off by one seg (lacks /cams/)
   [just an error in the esp:link url="/gkab/literacies ...]

-* esp2 grid attr script

-* esp2 image sizing issue

-* test all sub-logs in build process and report failures to nohup.out

-* lemindex vs. txtindex ???

-* http://oracc/cams/gkab/qpn?abaralah doesn't work

-* switching glossary when there is a search term should not delete the search
  term but shouldn't run the search either

-* glossary searches should enter item mode if nitems=1

-* Items->[click]->Pages doesn't work in adhoc mode or in glossary mode

-* what is happening with Huzirina [2] in search results of cams/gkab/find/tlit?lugal ?

-* cbd page 1 item 33 should be page 2 item 7

-* tertiary/designation sort should be configurable to use another
  field instead of designation, e.g., Nineveh sort on tablet number
  rather than designation: outline-default-final-sort-field;
  RESTRICTION: can't use designation in the sort fields right now

-* doc2/esp2 page-to-page linkage bug

-* esp links open in new page doesn't work; target=blank

-* esp-live needs re-implementing for esp2

-* esp1->esp2 migration script
   (&  write whats-changed in ESP2 page?)

-* glossary searches don't preserve the glossary context over a search 

-* cbd-items need special-casing

-* [Text::Cat.] button shouldn't display in gloss mode

-* qpn?anu-ab-us,ur doesn't do search; needs to do that and also enter item mode if nitems=1


Loose ends:
===========

* configuration fixing

* OTF final checks

* Score final fixes--generate individual witnesses from CMAwRo files

* o2-weblive and esp2-live need to coexist smoothly

* check that oracc esp and oracc esp live do the right thing once the switch to esp2 is complete

* implement qsn for Niek's sign-names; or implement this as a new proper noun type?

* o2-build scripts should never exit directly but should exec o2-exit.sh for clean-up

* p3-htmlview should be used for prebuild with filtering for proxies

* xtf-OATF


Bugs
====

* check trim entries with zero occurrences when with-all is no (recently
  radically changed this to fix PSU bugs)

* o2-prepare and oracc build prepare???


Install:
========

* misc/agg/data/* needs to be initialized on a new system but not
  reinstalled from source repeatedly--files need to be moved to
  oracc/agg and then relinked back to misc/agg/data


Documentation:
==============

* remove tut-generation from gdl/xdf schema doco

* refine and document project/00lib/pll.xml (e.g., dcclt) system for making LINKS dropdown items

* check on google analytics for other installations--need new id-somethings?

* document keydata.xml

* document variants, finally!


Refactoring:
============

* conflate misc/www and misc/web

* eliminate p2 directory; move or trash its contents as appropriate

* harmonize qcat/00lib/keydata.xml and xmd/keydata.xml

* re-evaluate use and build of project/01bld/www/p2.css

* rationalize pg/se code--there is a separate copy of p2.c in each and pg should probs be merged into se

* does the .notex/.note css have to be in p3/p3-template.xml?

* lots of old xxx-HTML (vel sim.) scripts to go

Features:
=========

* automatically/transparently upgrade txt index search to lem search
  on need rather than make the user have to choose

Opendata:
=========

* Oracc Authority Files (OAFs)

* templating for esp2 portals to create pages for each value in catalogue

* require OAF on all PGP pages

* OAFs are for labels; alignments provide commonality of referents

* Needs subscripting Enki₁ = oaf://o123313413; Enki₂ = oaf://o134234234

* oracc github project with translits named as P123213_TCL-5-15_cams-gkab.atf


Actions on SJT:
===============

* email bridget about perseus lemmatization helper etc.
