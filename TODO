P3:
===

* tertiary/designation sort should be configurable to use another field instead of designation, e.g., Nineveh sort on tablet number rather than designation: outline-default-final-sort-field

* doc2/esp2 page-to-page linkage bug

* esp links open in new page doesn't work; target=blank

* esp-live needs re-implementing for esp2

* esp2 image sizing issue

* esp1->esp2 migration script

* Check things that may have broken now that all p2 css/js has been removed


Loose ends:
===========

* configuration fixing

* OTF final checks

* Score final fixes--generate individual witnesses from CMAwRo files


Bugs
====

* check trim entries with zero occurrences when with-all is no (recently
  radically changed this to fix PSU bugs)

* o2-prepare and oracc build prepare???


Install:
========

* misc/agg/data/* needs to be initialized on a new system but not
  reinstalled from source repeatedly--files need to be moved to
  oracc/agg and then relinked back to misc/agg/data


Documentation:
==============

* remove tut-generation from gdl/xdf schema doco

* refine and document project/00lib/pll.xml (e.g., dcclt) system for making LINKS dropdown items

* check on google analytics for other installations--need new id-somethings?

* document keydata.xml


Refactoring:
============

* conflate misc/www and misc/web

* eliminate p2 directory; move or trash its contents as appropriate

* harmonize qcat/00lib/keydata.xml and xmd/keydata.xml

* re-evaluate use and build of project/01bld/www/p2.css

* rationalize pg/se code--there is a separate copy of p2.c in each and pg should probs be merged into se

* does the .notex/.note css have to be in p3/p3-template.xml?


Opendata:
=========

* Oracc Authority Files (OAFs)

* templating for esp2 portals to create pages for each value in catalogue

* require OAF on all PGP pages

* OAFs are for labels; alignments provide commonality of referents

* Needs subscripting Enki₁ = oaf://123313413; Enki₂ = oaf://134234234

* oracc github project with translits named as P123213-TCL_V-cams-gkab.atf

Actions on SJT:
===============

*email bridget about perseus lemmatization helper etc.
