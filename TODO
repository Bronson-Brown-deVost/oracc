P3:
===

-* tertiary/designation sort should be configurable to use another
  field instead of designation, e.g., Nineveh sort on tablet number
  rather than designation: outline-default-final-sort-field;
  RESTRICTION: can't use designation in the sort fields right now

-* doc2/esp2 page-to-page linkage bug

-* esp links open in new page doesn't work; target=blank

-* esp-live needs re-implementing for esp2

-* esp1->esp2 migration script
   (&  write whats=changed in ESP2 page?)

* esp2 image sizing issue

* scribesscholarsancestors: sort sequence bad for letters only; entries sort OK

* notes that come in GDL need fixing

* Items->[click]->Pages doesn't work in adhoc mode

* glossary searches should enter item mode if nitems=1

* switching glossary when there is a search term should not delete the search
  term but shouldn't run the search either

-* glossary searches don't preserve the glossary context over a search 

-* cbd-items need special-casing

-* [Text::Cat.] button shouldn't display in gloss mode

-* qpn?anu-ab-us,ur doesn't do search; needs to do that and also enter item mode if nitems=1

* test all sub-logs in build process and report failures to nohup.out

* Check things that may have broken now that all p2 css/js has been removed

* implement qsn for Niek's sign-names; or implement this as a new proper noun type?


Loose ends:
===========

* configuration fixing

* OTF final checks

* Score final fixes--generate individual witnesses from CMAwRo files

* o2-weblive and esp2-live need to coexist smoothly

* check that oracc esp and oracc esp live do the right thing once the switch to esp2 is complete


Bugs
====

* check trim entries with zero occurrences when with-all is no (recently
  radically changed this to fix PSU bugs)

* o2-prepare and oracc build prepare???


Install:
========

* misc/agg/data/* needs to be initialized on a new system but not
  reinstalled from source repeatedly--files need to be moved to
  oracc/agg and then relinked back to misc/agg/data


Documentation:
==============

* remove tut-generation from gdl/xdf schema doco

* refine and document project/00lib/pll.xml (e.g., dcclt) system for making LINKS dropdown items

* check on google analytics for other installations--need new id-somethings?

* document keydata.xml

* document variants, finally!

Refactoring:
============

* conflate misc/www and misc/web

* eliminate p2 directory; move or trash its contents as appropriate

* harmonize qcat/00lib/keydata.xml and xmd/keydata.xml

* re-evaluate use and build of project/01bld/www/p2.css

* rationalize pg/se code--there is a separate copy of p2.c in each and pg should probs be merged into se

* does the .notex/.note css have to be in p3/p3-template.xml?


Opendata:
=========

* Oracc Authority Files (OAFs)

* templating for esp2 portals to create pages for each value in catalogue

* require OAF on all PGP pages

* OAFs are for labels; alignments provide commonality of referents

* Needs subscripting Enki₁ = oaf://o123313413; Enki₂ = oaf://o134234234

* oracc github project with translits named as P123213_TCL-5-15_cams-gkab.atf

Actions on SJT:
===============

*email bridget about perseus lemmatization helper etc.
