Configure and Install Oracc
===========================

  Run the OS install script: sudo ./lnx-config.sh; sudo ./mac-config.sh.


Oracc Environment Variables
===========================

Oracc has several environment variables which must be set at install time:

* ORACC

  The location of installed Oracc software, default = /usr/local/oracc

* ORACC_MODE

  The user-mode of the installation, either 'single', i.e., one user, or
  'multi', i.e., multiple users.

  In 'single' mode, there is no user 'oracc' (unless that is the single
  user).  In 'multi' mode there must be a system user 'oracc.

* ORACC_HOME

  The location of Oracc projects.  In a 'multi' installation this is 
  /home on Unix or /Users on Mac.  In a 'single' installation this may
  be either /usr/local/oracc or any other directory that the Oracc
  installation has access to.  If the 'single' installation is on a
  personal computer, ~/oracc-projects is the default location

* ORACC_USER

  This is 'yes' if there is a system user named oracc, no otherwise. An
  oracc user is required for multi mode but is optional otherwise.

* ORACC_HOST

  This should be the full domain name of the Oracc server on which the
  instance is running.
