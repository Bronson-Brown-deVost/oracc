Operating System Setup
======================

  Follow instructions in OS install notes/scripts

  ... yum/pkg scripts ...


Obtaining Oracc
===============

  Clone the Oracc repo into your user account:

  git clone  https://github.com/oracc/oracc.git


Set up Oracc Environment
========================

Copy the sample oraccenv to oraccenv.sh:

  cp oraccenv.example oraccenv.sh
  
Edit oraccenv.sh following the documentation of the Environment at the end of this file.

Set up the environment using oraccenv.sh:

  . oraccenv.sh


Configure and Install Oracc
===========================

  sudo ./preconfig.sh
  ./lnx-config.sh or ./mac-config.sh
  sudo ./makeinstall.sh

(if you want to build with debugging info, run ./lnx-config.sh CFLAGS=-g)


Configure Apache for Oracc
==========================

Review the file oracc-vhost.conf which was created during the configuration process.  When
it meets your server's requirements type:

   sudo ./install-oracc-vhost-conf.sh

Linux:

	Check that your iptables accept tcp port 80 using iptables -L -n.  If you don't see
	something like:

	ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           state NEW tcp dpt:80 

	then add it with:

	     /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

Mac OS X:

	This was easy up until Mountain Lion.  See this page for notes and a link to a page
	that makes it easy again:

Oracc Environment Variables
===========================

Oracc has several environment variables which must be set at install time:

* ORACC

  The location of installed Oracc software, default = /usr/local/oracc

* ORACC_MODE

  The user-mode of the installation, either 'single', i.e., one user, or
  'multi', i.e., multiple users.

  In 'single' mode, there is no user 'oracc' (unless that is the single
  user).  In 'multi' mode there must be a system user 'oracc.

* ORACC_HOME

  The location of Oracc projects.  In a 'multi' installation this is 
  /home on Unix or /Users on Mac.  In a 'single' installation this may
  be either /usr/local/oracc or any other directory that the Oracc
  installation has access to.  If the 'single' installation is on a
  personal computer, ~/oracc-projects is the default location

* ORACC_USER

  This is 'yes' if there is a system user named oracc, no otherwise. An
  oracc user is required for multi mode but is optional otherwise.

* ORACC_HOST

  This should be the full domain name of the Oracc server on which the
  instance is running.
