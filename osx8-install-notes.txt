Prerequisites
=============

as of XCode 4.4.1 libtool/autoconf/automake are not in Mac dist so:

  install base macports package for your OS version from macports.org
  cd ~
  . .profile
  sudo port install autoconf
  sudo port install automake
  sudo port install libtool
  sudo port install gdbm
  sudo port install pcre
  sudo port install msort
  sudo port install qdbm

(occasionally you may get an empty reply from server; just try again a few minutes later)

---

github clone oracc (or use dist)

rm aclocal.m4 acinclude.m4

glibtoolize
aclocal
automake
autoconf
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/oracc
make
make install


Build notes:
============

For oracc-hyperestraier:

  remove /usr/local/include/iconv.h and /usr/local/lib/*iconv* if you 
  	 have /usr/include and /usr/bin iconv (if you get bad iconv symbols)

  ??  install zlib (-lz)  ?? didn't do this for bfos1 install

---

N.B.:
=====

Macports installs its own perl in /opt/local/bin, but Oracc's perl scripts currently use #!/usr/bin/perl (this should be fixed).

Until it is fixed:

      sudo su
      cd /usr/bin
      mv perl perl-mac-os-orig
      ln -sf /opt/local/bin/perl perl
