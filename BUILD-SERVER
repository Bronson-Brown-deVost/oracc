userid oracc is required

group oracc is required (needs to be created separately on Mac OS X)

oracc home dir is /home/oracc or /Users/oracc

ORACC_BUILDS is /home/oracc or /home/USERS/builds vel sim

ORACC_BUILDS must have perms for write by apache

ownership on files should be primary maintainer id; this can be the oracc user
or it can be another user account in which case for a user 'stinney' do:

 sudo su -
 cd /home/oracc
 chmod -R stinney:oracc .

default perms for files are 660 (rwxrwx---)

dirs must be exec as well, which is 770

prefix this with 2 for setgid (set-group-id) so full oracc dir perms are 2770

   find . -type d -exec chmod 2770 '{}' ';'

maintainer logins are optional

apache/_www must be in oracc group

To add a user to oracc group:

   usermod -aG oracc apache/_www

To set the oracc home dir to propagate group ownership and deny read/write/x to users not in the group:

   chmod -R 2660 /home/oracc

maintainers need to add Oracc environment info to  ~/.bash_profile
