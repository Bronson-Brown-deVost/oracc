Oracc Installation Levels
=========================

Oracc installations support different levels of activity as follows:

* Work

  Create and check text editions; perform lemmatization

* Build

  Create and manage projects+

* Web

  Run a full Oracc webserver from pre-built projects

* Full

  All of the above



Oracc Environment Variables
===========================

Oracc has several environment variables which must be set at install time:

* ORACC

  The location of installed Oracc software, default = /usr/local/oracc

* ORACC_MODE

  The user-mode of the installation, either 'single', i.e., one user, or
  'multi', i.e., multiple users.

  In 'single' mode, there is no user 'oracc' (unless that is the single
  user).  In 'multi' mode there must be a system user 'oracc.

* ORACC_HOME

  The location of Oracc projects.  In a 'multi' installation this is 
  /home on Unix or /Users on Mac.  In a 'single' installation this may
  be either /usr/local/oracc or any other directory that the Oracc
  installation has access to.  If the 'single' installation is on a
  personal computer, ~/oracc-projects is the default location
